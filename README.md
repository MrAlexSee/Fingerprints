## Basic information

A proof-of-concept program for lightweight fingerprints for fast approximate keyword matching. Authors: Aleksander Cis≈Çak, Szymon Grabowski.

Accepted for publication as *Lightweight Fingerprints for Fast Approximate Keyword Matching Using Bitwise Operations* in Computing and Informatics journal.
A preprint is available at the following link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08475.

## Compilation

Add Boost library to the path for compilation by setting `BOOST_DIR` in the makefile. 
Requires Boost program options module to be compiled for static linking.
Requires support for the C++14 standard.

Type `make` for optimized compile.
Comment out `OPTFLAGS` in the makefile in order to disable optimization.

Tested with gcc 64-bit 7.2.0 and Boost 1.67.0 (the latter is not performance-critical, used only for parameter and data parsing and formatting) on Ubuntu 17.10 Linux version 4.13.0-36 64-bit.

A binary (compiled executable) for Linux is available in the release (file name `fingerprints`).

## Usage

Basic usage: `./fingerprints [options] <input dictionary file> <input pattern file>`

Input dictionary file (positional parameter 1 or named parameter `-i` or `--in-dict-file`) should contain the list of words, separated with newline characters.
Input pattern file (positional parameter 2 or named parameter `-I` or `--in-pattern-file`) should contain the list of patterns, separated with newline characters.
Attached as part of this package are scripts `test_real.sh` for testing on real-world data and `test_synth.sh` for testing on synthetic data.

* End-to-end tests are located in the `end_to_end_tests` folder and they can be run using the `run_tests.sh` script in that folder.
* Unit tests are located in the `unit_tests` folder and they can be run by issuing the `make run` command in that folder.
* The `scripts` directory contains some helpful Python 2 tools.

`-I`       | `--in-pattern-file arg`  | input pattern file path (positional arg 2)
&nbsp;     | `--iter arg`             | number of iterations per pattern lookup (default = 1)
`-k`       | `--approx arg`           | perform approximate search (Hamming or Levenshtein) for k errors
`-l`       | `--letters-type arg`     | letters type: common, mixed, rare (default = common)
`-o`       | `--out-file arg`         | output file path (default = res.txt)
`-p`       | `--pattern-count arg`    | maximum number of patterns read from top of the pattern file (non-positive values are ignored)
&nbsp;     | `--pattern-size arg`     | if set, only patterns of this size (letter count) will be read from the pattern file (non-positive values are ignored)
`-s`       | `--separator arg`        | input data (dictionary and patterns) separator (default = newline)
`-v`       | `--version`              | display version info
`-w`       | `--word-count arg`       | maximum number of words read from top of the dictionary file (non-positive values are ignored)
